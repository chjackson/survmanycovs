Appendix Table 14. Log odds ratios from model for predictors of death before hospital admission. Odds defined as probability of death before admission divided by probability of recovery without admission.  (Note: as there were no deaths from onsets in June, the odds rat io for death following onset in June was constrained to be equal to that for May.  Due to the small numbers of deaths in the two age groups below 65, these groups were merged. No deaths before admission were observed among healthcare workers, so this predictor was excluded.)
